[7. ABSTRACT SUMMARY]

This project aims to validate one or two natural compounds with modulatory potential in a mouse model of obesity with induced heart failure, determining their cardioprotective effects and the pathways involved in the regulation of mitochondrial oxidative stress and Caï¿½? overload. Candidates will be selected based on a theoretical-experimental approach that includes in vitro evaluations in H9c2 cardiomyocytes with angiotensin II-induced hypertrophy, in vivo evaluations in C57BL/6J mice with induced heart failure, and ex vivo evaluations in cardiac tissue. Validation of safe and selective therapeutic modulators of PPARs could restore impaired energy metabolism and mitochondrial function, thereby preventing the progression of mitochondrial dysfunction, supporting their development as a rational strategy.
