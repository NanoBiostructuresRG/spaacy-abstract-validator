# background
The widespread use of dietary supplements containing testosterone and synthetic anabolic analogs has raised growing concerns regarding consumer safety and regulatory oversight. These compounds, often undeclared or mislabeled, pose health risks and complicate efforts in quality control and market surveillance. In response, there is an increasing demand for analytical tools capable of detecting such molecules with high sensitivity and selectivity. Aptamers—short, single-stranded oligonucleotides that fold into specific three-dimensional structures—have emerged as promising biorecognition elements for detecting small-molecule targets. However, their performance under physiologically relevant conditions remains insufficiently characterized, particularly in terms of structural stability and binding affinity to steroidal compounds.
# hypothesis
High structural adaptability and great stability in aptamer sequences are expected to result in selective binding to testosterone and its synthetic analogs in complex matrices under physiological conditions, supporting their application as biorecognition elements in biosensing platforms.
# methodology
This project will employ a combined in silico and in vitro analytical strategy to evaluate the suitability of eight candidate aptamer sequences. Secondary and tertiary structure predictions will be obtained using [SPECIFY TOOL] under varying ionic strength and temperature conditions, followed by molecular docking simulations [SPECIFY TOOL] to assess target-binding performance. In vitro analyses will include dynamic light scattering to examine aptamer folding and conformational stability, and capture assays involving immobilized aptamers exposed to testosterone and its analogs. 
# outcomes
The study aims to generate a comparative performance profile of the candidate aptamers, identify the most stable and selective sequence for biosensor integration, and establish structure–function correlations relevant to binding efficiency.
# impact
This project will contribute to the rational design of next-generation biosensors for endocrine compound detection supporting public health efforts and improving monitoring strategies in regulatory frameworks.
